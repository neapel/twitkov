This needs MySQL. Sorry.


Scripts will ask for credentials on first call, all information will be stored in 'cred.json' (clear text).

Run './parse.py --new' to create tables and begin analyzing the stream.
(every time you use the '--new' flag, previous statistical information will be deleted!)


Run './generate.py --new' to generate tweets. These will be stored in a table, too, so no duplicates will be generated (also, no tweets resembling original material). Leave the '--new' flag on subsequent calls, so you won't loose old tweets.
(both scripts generate their own tables, and won't delete other's)
